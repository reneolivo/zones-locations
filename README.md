# Zones Locations

A bunch of locations in the Dominican Republic, thanks to [@Raydelto](https://github.com/raydelto/provincias_dominicanas).

The locations are displayed in a list and the location's geolocation coordinates are to be deducted using the Google Maps Geocoding API.

To run the demo use `bower install` and then open the index.html file in your prefered browser.
